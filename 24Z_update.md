## Added functionalities:

- Miditok library upgrade: from 2.1.7 to 3.0.4
- Added PerTok tokenizator
- New logics of corresponding notes with tokens (forced by library upgrade)
- New parameters in configuration (mostly for PetTok): use_programs, use_microtiming, ticks_per_quarter, max_microtiming_shift, num_microtiming_bins
- Default tokenizator classes, now associating notes to tokens is run after we receive tokens, unifed functions for all tokenizers depending on "use_programs" parameter usage 

### frontend:

- New design in general
- Subtle animations
- New piano roll- high resoultion, stable keybord so it does not vanish with scrolling
- Tokens can be paginated and scaled
- New audio player
